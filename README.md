# Corporate Stress Analysis
**Week 2: Temporal Analysis of Workplace Stress** <br/>
Analyzed workplace stress through a temporal lens by categorizing employee experience levels and sleep patterns. Developed Power BI visualizations: (1) a line chart showing stress trends across career stages and (2) a matrix table illustrating the inverse relationship between sleep and stress. AI-assisted design process helped refine visualization choices, but manual adjustments were needed for bin-based trends and interactivity.

**Week 3: Geospatial Analysis of Workplace Stress**<br/>
Conducted geospatial analysis of workplace stress in India, adding city, state, and tier data to enhance spatial insights. Implemented two Power BI visualizations: (1) a bubble map displaying city-level stress variations and (2) a choropleth map showing state-wise stress distribution. AI suggestions aided in visualization selection, but manual adjustments were required for missing tier-city mappings and Power BI constraints.

Incorporating some suggestions that were provided during peer review, following updates were made: <br/>
**Choropleth Map Color Scale:**<br/>
Original: Low stress (Pink) → High stress (Blue).<br/>
Modified: Low stress (Green) → High stress (Red).<br/>
The new scale provides a more intuitive contrast for stakeholders.<br/>
**Added Job Role Filter in Updated Version:**<br/>
Allows users to filter stress levels by specific job roles (e.g., Analyst, HR, Manager).<br/>
Improves customization for HR leaders and employees.<br/>

**Week 4: Categorical & Linguistic Analysis of Workplace Stress**<br/>
Explored categorical and text data to understand health issues, discrimination, and job role distributions. Created Python visualizations: (1) a bar chart for health issue prevalence, (2) a word cloud for job roles, and (3) heatmaps for gender-based discrimination analysis. AI provided guidance on visualization choices and data preprocessing, but manual refinements improved clarity and interactivity.

**Week 5: Tree and Network Visualizations of Workplace Stress**<br/>
Performed network analysis to examine job role stress and inter-department collaborations. Developed two Python-based visualizations: (1) a tree structure showing job role stress distribution and (2) a graph network mapping department collaborations and stress levels. AI assisted in selecting visualization techniques, but manual refinements were necessary for layout optimization and annotation clarity. Future improvements include interactive dashboards for HR decision-making.

**Incorporating some suggestions that were provided during peer review, following updates were made:** <br/>
Color Mapping Improved:<br/>
Original: Used only red-based coloring for stress levels.<br/>
Modified: Now coolwarm color gradient (Blue → Red) to clearly differentiate low vs. high stress roles.<br/>

**Node Size Scaling Added:**<br/>
Original: Fixed-size nodes, making it hard to compare roles.<br/>
Modified: Nodes now scale based on employee count, making high-population job roles more prominent.<br/>

**Edge Weight Adjustments:**<br/>
Original: Uniform edge thickness.<br/>
Modified: Edges now vary in width, representing the stress propagation effect between Corporate & Job Roles.<br/>

**Colorbar Added:**<br/>
Original: No reference scale for stress values.<br/>
Modified: Now includes a colorbar, helping stakeholders interpret stress intensity more clearly.<br/>
